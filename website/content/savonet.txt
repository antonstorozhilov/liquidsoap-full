h3. What is Savonet?

Savonet is a group of open-source developers working on multimedia streaming, with a focus on web radios.
Savonet software is mainly written in "OCaml":http://ocaml.org.
Our main end-user tool is Liquidsoap,
the programming language that ties all the pieces together.
Note that the liquidsoap language is not OCaml;
it draws inspiration from various languages, but you don't need to know
that to use liquidsoap.
Savonet also provides OCaml libraries to the open-source community,
in particular bindings of widespread C libraries such as
SSL, Vorbis, Mad, Lame, Jack, ALSA, LADSPA, etc.

The project was started in 2003 by David Baelde and Samuel Mimram,
two computer science students at "ENS Lyon":http://www.ens-lyon.fr/DI, France.
It became the official promotion-wide project the next year.
By the end of the semester,
our final demo was a big failure, but a few of us kept working at
it, so that the project eventually took off and attracted new
contributors. Romain Beauxis joined the project in 2006, to quickly
become one of the three main developers.
