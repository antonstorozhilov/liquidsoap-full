title: Download and install liquidsoap


h2. Installing Savonet/Liquidsoap

You can install liquidsoap with OPAM (recommended), from source, or using a
package available for your distribution.

* "Using OPAM":#opam
* "From source":#source
* "Debian/Ubuntu":#deb
* "Windows":#win32
* "ArchLinux":#arch
* "Latest development version":#latest

h3@opam. Install using OPAM

The recommended method to install liquidsoap is by using the "OCaml Package
Manager":http://opam.ocaml.org/. OPAM is available in all major distributions
and on windows. We actively support the liquidsoap packages there and its
dependencies. After installing OPAM for the first time, you should run

%%
opam init
%%

You should now be able to install liquidsoap by executing:

%%
opam install liquidsoap
%%

If you want to update Liquidsoap to the latest version, simply execute:

%%
opam update
opam upgrade
%%

h3@source. Installing from source

You can download source code published by Savonet from the "github releases
page":https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap/releases.

The recommended way for newcomers is to use the liquidsoap-full-xxx.tar.gz
tarball. This tarball includes all required OCaml bindings and allows you to
compile and install liquidsoap in a single @configure@, @make@ and @make
install@ procedure. You will still need the corresponding C libraries and their
development files, though.

You will then have to "build the source":doc-svn/build.html.

h3@deb. Debian/Ubuntu packages

Liquidsoap is included in Debian and Ubuntu distributions:

* "Debian packages":http://packages.debian.org/liquidsoap
* "Ubuntu packages":http://packages.ubuntu.com/liquidsoap

h3@win32. Windows

We do not maintain windows build for liquidsoap anymore. See "this page":windows.html for instructions on how to build it yourself.

h3@arch. ArchLinux

A package for Arch Linux users is available from the distribution,
see the "ArchLinux Liquidsoap package page":https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/liquidsoap/

h3@latest. Git repository (and other distributions)

If you want a cutting-edge version, you can use the git repository.
To get a copy of it, you have to run:

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/savonet/liquidsoap-full.git liquidsoap
cd liquidsoap
make init
</pre>

After, that you have to create a list of modules that you want to compile. A
good starting point is to do

<pre>
cp PACKAGES.minimal PACKAGES
</pre>

and edit the @PACKAGES@ file to uncomment the libraries you are interested in.
You should then run the configuration scripts by

<pre>
./bootstrap
./configure
</pre>

and finally build Liquidsoap:

<pre>
make
</pre>

After that, you should synchronize the repository from time to time using

<pre>
make update
</pre>

Some more explanations can be found in the "build instructions":doc-svn/build.html.
